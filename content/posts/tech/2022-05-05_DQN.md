# DQN Framework

Here is Network listed:

- CNN + Q Learning: CNN for frame-skiped images features extraction; and Q Learning for policy generation

## Key 1: Input Infos Preprocessing
    - Key Frame and Action Repeat
      - select skipped frames (每个4帧选取关键帧)
    - Grayscale, Downsampling and Cropping
      - RGB channels to gray scale channel (将RGB取均值为灰度图)
    - History as Input
      - continuous history key frames as input (连续四个关键帧作为输入)
## Key 2: Replay Buffer
    - Decorrelate
    - Smooth Distribution Change
## Key 3: Semi-Gradient Method
